# Contributing to Flutter Number Flow

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Flutter Number Flow as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/flutter_number_flow.git
   cd flutter_number_flow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   cd example && flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the example app**
   ```bash
   cd example
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

5. **Run analysis**
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

### Code Style

- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for style issues
- Format your code with `dart format`
- Write descriptive commit messages

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Run `flutter test` before submitting
- Include golden tests for visual components
- Aim for high test coverage

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add inline documentation for public APIs
- Include code examples in documentation
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
